                </figure>

                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">In a period marked by transitions, the global economy is
                    adjusting to shifts toward trade patterns, evolving energy markets, post-pandemic recoveries,
                    changes in labor and impacts of artificial intelligence. Supply chains are being reorganized,
                    monetary policies are calibrating to changing inflation dynamics, and firms are reassessing
                    investment plans due to technology adoption and updates in laws, regulations and policy changes.</p>

                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Prof. Dr. Erdem Başçı, faculty member in the Economics
                    Department at TED University, former Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye, former
                    Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Türkiye to the OECD between 2016–2021, and Academic
                    Advisor to the TED University Economics Research Union, provided structured reflections addressing
                    monetary transmission, price stability, financial intermediation, and considerations for policy
                    design and market expectations.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">1) Why have inflation, uncertainties, and AI become so critical?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">All three have serious importance for the society at
                    large, and all three rose rapidly and unexpectedly. When Nobel laureate economist Thomas Sargent
                    published his book titled "The Conquest of American Inflation" in 2001, no one expected inflation to
                    reappear as a problem, until the pandemic in 2020.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Since the establishment of the WTO in 1995, efforts were
                    directed toward removing barriers to international trade, and tariff rates remained durably low
                    globally, until the changes in the stance of the US administration in 2018 and 2025. When public
                    research funding for AI was completely cut in the 1980s, no one expected AI to become part of our
                    daily lives. All of these took place after the "deep learning" revolution in 2010.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">2) Has today's high inflation been driven more by supply shocks or
                    demand-side policies?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Research especially points to demand-side factors playing
                    a larger role in the rise of inflation in the US. In addition to expansionary monetary and fiscal
                    policies, I also think that the loosening of macroprudential policies played an important role on
                    excessive monetary expansion after the pandemic.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">The ability to use bank capital adequacy ratios
                    countercyclically became possible during the 2020 pandemic shock, and this was very effective in
                    reviving the money-credit mechanism. In 2009, this tool could not have been used, because the
                    problem at that time originated in the significant erosion of banks' equity capital base.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">3) How are inflation dynamics changing for emerging economies?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">The key role of expectations once again reflects itself
                    in inflation dynamics. As using expectations as the nominal anchor may become more difficult in
                    these countries, the difficulty increases when inflation expectations become heterogeneous. In such
                    cases, nominal money-credit growth could once again assume the role of a supporting nominal anchor.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Concerns about the possibility of excessive monetary
                    policy expansion and the uncertainty surrounding this can have a lasting adverse effect on money
                    demand and may, in the long run, trigger significantly high inflation.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">4) How do geopolitical risks and protectionism affect inflation?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Protectionism can have a one-time effect that raises the
                    price level. Whether this turns into sustained higher inflation depends on the policy response of
                    the central banks. If an inflationary policy is implemented and the nominal anchor property of
                    expectations is eroded, this can indeed turn into inflation. A similar argument applies to
                    geopolitical shocks through energy price hikes.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">5) Is AI an opportunity or a risk for emerging economies?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">I think the opportunity side is greater. Learning these
                    technologies is not that difficult. Finding sufficiently powerful hardware is also quite easy these
                    days. Emerging economies which can adapt their education systems will be able to obtain net benefits
                    from the presence and further development of artificial intelligence technologies.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">6) AI as complement or substitute?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Progress in image and speech recognition accelerated
                    considerably after 2010. In disease diagnosis, it may be complementary to physicians for now but
                    more substitutive in the long run. However, in robotic microsurgery, the complementary effect will
                    be more prominent.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">7) CBDC and stablecoins — disinflationary or inflationary?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">CBDC can be considered the closest substitute for paper
                    money. As a liability of the central bank, this type of money can be safely used in purchases and
                    debt payments. It is more likely that this type of money would substitute for paper currency rather
                    than be inflationary.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Stablecoins will not be a problem as long as they are
                    backed on a full reserve basis by fiat currencies or safe public securities. However, how and by
                    whom these reserves will be audited has not yet been clarified. This private form of money can
                    become inflationary to the extent of the growth rate of its balances and the degree that they
                    facilitate the monetization of government budget deficits.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">8) Will digital currencies become primary payment methods?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">CBDC is already being designed as a convenient and
                    low-cost payment tool, including for cross-border payments. For a country like Sweden, which aims to
                    eliminate paper money, this could become a natural mainstream payment method.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Stablecoins are offered with the claim of being a
                    cost-free payment tool. Their continued viability will depend on whether their promised "par"
                    features are truly sustainable.</p>
