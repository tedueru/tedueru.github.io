                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Transitioning from mathematics to the world of social
                    sciences, Prof. Dr. Nazire Nergiz Dinçer has built a career defined by the vital intersection of
                    academic discipline and real-world policy. Her journey reflects a unique blend of experiences,
                    beginning with her education at METU and Bilkent University, followed by her role as a planning
                    expert at the State Planning Organization (SPO). During her years at the SPO, she witnessed the
                    Turkish economy's most critical turning points firsthand, from the 1999 earthquake to the 2001
                    financial crisis, gaining a "masterclass" in institutional coordination and policy framework.</p>

                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">In this interview, Prof. Dinçer shares her insights on a
                    global academic trajectory, including her postdoctoral research at the University of California,
                    Berkeley. Beyond her international experience, she provides a deep dive into her current roles as
                    the Chair of the Economics Department at TED University and the Director of the TEDU Sustainable
                    Trade Research Center (sTAM). She also addresses the systemic challenges women face in the
                    profession, advocating for a more inclusive and solidarity-driven future.</p>

                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;"><em>We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our
                        professor for her time and for always supporting us. Your guidance has truly made a difference
                        in our journey, and we are so thankful for everything.</em></p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">1) What initially motivated your transition from mathematics to
                    economics?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">When I first started university, I already knew that I
                    loved research and wanted to pursue an academic path. However, while I was in the mathematics
                    department, I began to feel that the field was very traditional. I worried that it would be
                    difficult for me to contribute something truly original there. That's what pushed me toward the
                    social sciences. Economics really appealed to me—it had a strong mathematical foundation, but the
                    subject matter felt so much more alive and compelling.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">While I was working on my master's, I decided to take the
                    State Planning Organization (SPO) entrance exam just to test my skills, and I passed. At the time,
                    my heart was set on a PhD, but my supervisors encouraged me to balance both my professional and
                    academic life. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. The SPO was basically an
                    academy back then; department heads would literally stand at the blackboard and lecture us.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">2) You spent time at UC Berkeley. What did this experience contribute?
                </h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Since I completed my PhD in Türkiye, I recognized the
                    need for international experience to broaden my perspective. My goal was to collaborate with a
                    leading scholar at a prestigious institution. This ambition led me to Professor Barry Eichengreen,
                    and I subsequently joined the University of California, Berkeley, for my postdoc studies. This
                    proved to be a highly productive period, enabling me to publish in top-tier journals.</p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">If I were to give one piece of advice to students today,
                    it would be this: actively seek out the opportunities provided by TÜBİTAK scholarships. Programs
                    like the Jean Monnet Scholarship can give you a massive advantage. Don't wait for opportunities to
                    come to you; go after them.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">3) Reflections on the critical period at the SPO?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">I joined the State Planning Organization (SPO) in
                    November 1998. I witnessed major turning points such as the 1999 earthquake and the 2000–2001
                    financial crises firsthand from a bureaucratic perspective. Those years were a real masterclass in
                    how important it is to have strong policy frameworks and seamless coordination between institutions.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">Then came the 2023 earthquakes, a tragedy that changed
                    everything. I pivoted my research agenda toward disaster economics. Today, about 60–70% of my work
                    is focused on this field, with a clear goal in mind: finding ways to build economic resilience for
                    our future.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">4) What factors led you to focus on international economics and central
                    banking?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">In the beginning, my focus was macroeconomics. However,
                    the frequent structural breaks in Turkish economic data made it difficult to conduct reliable
                    time-series analysis. This technical hurdle eventually steered me toward microeconomics. It was
                    during this transition that I began collaborating with Prof. Dr. Ayça Tekin-Koru, merging her deep
                    micro-level insights with my macro background.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">5) About TED University's Economics programmes?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">TED University is a young, dynamic institution. Our
                    Department of Economics boasts a truly distinguished faculty, with six full professors and two
                    assistant professors. Students are admitted to the faculty first and only choose their specific
                    major at the end of their first year. Our master's program is very much 'boutique' by design. Our
                    graduates are remarkably successful, consistently moving on to PhD programs at prestigious
                    universities both here in Türkiye and abroad.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">6) Importance of studying economics today?</h3>
                <div class="quote-box">"You can work in fields like physics, mathematics, or chemistry. In those
                    disciplines, the human factor isn't at the core. But if you're an economist—you inevitably need
                    people. You simply must understand them." — Prof. Dr. Fikret Görün</div>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">We're living in a time where societies are evolving at an
                    unprecedented pace. Whether we're looking at trade wars or the local impacts of climate change,
                    these challenges demand innovative, human-centric policies. Understanding these dynamics makes an
                    economics education more vital than it has ever been.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">7) Women's representation in economics?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">We wanted to make the barriers women face visible and
                    challenge the traditionally "masculine" culture of our field. For us, İBKİ isn't just an
                    organization; it's a solidarity network where we mentor young economists and work to dismantle the
                    gendered codes built into our institutions. My call to all colleagues: let's build this inclusive
                    future together.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">8) About TEDUsTAM?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">This center was originally established in 2014 as the
                    'Trade Research Center.' As sustainability became inseparable from trade, we rebranded it as
                    TEDUsTAM. One of our most exciting current projects involves a massive new dataset from
                    sustainability reports of 705 firms listed on Borsa Istanbul. I'd invite students who are passionate
                    about these topics to reach out and collaborate!</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">9) What does sustainability mean for economics?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">At its core, economics is all about making choices under
                    scarcity—so economics is the very heart of sustainability. With sustainability reporting becoming
                    mandatory in both the EU and Türkiye, we're seeing a massive rise in demand for "green-collar"
                    professionals. This knowledge won't just be an 'extra' anymore—it will be an absolute necessity.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">10) The circular economy and consumerism?</h3>
                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;">The circular economy is so much more than just 'zero
                    waste'; it's an entirely new way of thinking. Products are designed for longevity from day one. I
                    always encourage students to check out the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.</p>
                <ul style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.85;margin:1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Japan:</strong> Newspapers produced that, once read, can be planted in soil and will
                        grow into seeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hiut Denim &amp; Patagonia:</strong> Highly durable products with free repair services,
                        extending product life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Ducks used instead of pesticides or fertilizers, resulting in a
                        sixfold increase in productivity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin-top:2.5rem;">11) Advice for students and aspiring academics?</h3>
                <ul style="font-size:1rem;line-height:1.85;margin:1rem 0 1rem 1.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Read extensively:</strong> A social scientist cannot sustain an intellectual life
                        without reading.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use artificial intelligence but verify:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT can be useful but
                        are prone to errors. Always verify outputs critically.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="font-size:1.05rem;line-height:1.85;margin-top:2rem;"><em>As TED University Economics Research
                        Union, we thank Prof. Dr. Nazire Nergiz Dinçer for this special interview and her support in our
                        works.</em></p>
